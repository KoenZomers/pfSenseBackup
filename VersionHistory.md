## Version History

2.5 - released December 1, 2019 - [download](https://github.com/KoenZomers/pfSenseBackup/raw/master/Releases/pfSenseBackupv2.5.zip) - 10 kb

- Added support for connecting to OPNSense
- Migration to .NET Core - builds are multiplaform (Windows, Linux, Mac) and self-contained (no need to install any framework).

2.4.2 - released February 22, 2017 - [download](https://github.com/KoenZomers/pfSenseBackup/raw/master/Releases/pfSenseBackupv2.4.2.zip) - 10 kb

- There was a minor modification to the backup page in pfSense 2.3.3. Added support for 2.3.3 and made it the default version. So if you're on 2.3.3 you don't need to provide the -v flag. If you're still on 2.3 you need to provide the -v 2.3 still.

2.4.1 - released April 6, 2016 - [download](https://github.com/KoenZomers/pfSenseBackup/raw/master/Releases/pfSenseBackupv2.4.1.zip) - 10 kb

- Incorrectly referenced the update to being for pfSense 3.2 whereas it should have been 2.3. Changed it in this minor update. Be sure to use the -v 2.3 flag.

2.4 - released April 5, 2016 - [download](https://github.com/KoenZomers/pfSenseBackup/raw/master/Releases/pfSenseBackupv2.4.zip) - 10 kb

- Added support for pfSense version 2.3 RC. Provide the -v 2.3 flag to instruct pfSenseBackup to use the protocol added for pfSense v2.3
- pfSenseBackup now requires the Microsoft .NET framework v4.6 to be installed (was 4.0 before) as pfSense v2.3 requires TLS 1.2 for SSL. Prior versions of the .NET Framework only support TLS 1.0. This requirement is regardless of which pfSense version you want to target.

2.3 - released February 4, 2016 - [download](https://github.com/KoenZomers/pfSenseBackup/raw/master/Releases/pfSenseBackupv2.3.zip) - 10 kb

- Added option -t to instruct pfSense to use a different request timeout for slow connections as requested by ilyahub in [Issue #1](https://github.com/KoenZomers/pfSenseBackup/issues/1)

2.2 - released August 11, 2015 - [download](https://github.com/KoenZomers/pfSenseBackup/raw/master/Releases/pfSenseBackupv2.2.zip) - 10 kb

2.1 - released June 28, 2015 - [download](https://github.com/KoenZomers/pfSenseBackup/raw/master/Releases/pfSenseBackupv2.1.zip) - 10 kb

- Usernames and passwords sent to pfSense will now first be UrlEncoded. This allows usernames and passwords to be used with special characters like the + sign. Thanks to Marc Mittelman for pointing out this issue!
- Retargeted the .NET Framework to v4.0 as v2.0 to which it was set before isn't shipped by default anymore on modern Windows client & server operating systems

2.0 - released May 20, 2015 - [download](https://github.com/KoenZomers/pfSenseBackup/raw/master/Releases/pfSenseBackupv2.0.zip) - 9 kb

- Changed the way parameters are parsed so that it now also is possible to use the -o parameter and specify a location which contains spaces. Use double quotes to wrap the location in case it contains a space. I.e. -o "c:\my backups" or -o "c:\backups\my backup file.xml" or you may omit the quotes if you don't have any spaces -o c:\backups or -o c:\backups\mybackup.xml or -o "c:\backups\mybackup.xml". Thanks to David Zachhuber for pointing out this issue!

1.9 - released February 20, 2015 - [download](https://github.com/KoenZomers/pfSenseBackup/raw/master/Releases/pfSenseBackupv1.9.zip) - 9 kb

- Added support for pfSense version 2.2
- Added the option to use the -o parameter to specify an existing folder. The backup file will be stored inside that folder using the filename as provided by pfSense, which is in the format config-<servername>-<year><month><day><hour><minute><second>.xml. It is still possible to use the -o parameter to provide a full path including filename as well.

1.8 - released November 2, 2013 - [download](https://github.com/KoenZomers/pfSenseBackup/raw/master/Releases/pfSenseBackupv1.8.zip) - 9 kb

1.7 - released August 27, 2013 - [download](https://github.com/KoenZomers/pfSenseBackup/raw/master/Releases/pfSenseBackupv1.7.zip) - 12 kb

1.4 - released May 8, 2013 - [download](https://github.com/KoenZomers/pfSenseBackup/raw/master/Releases/pfSenseBackupv1.4.zip) - 12 kb

- Support has been added for pfSense version 2.1 released on or after May 2013. This now includes an anti cross site scripting security token in the login page which caused the application to have to be rewritten.
- Default is now version 2.1 of the protocol which expects the security token in the login page. If you want to backup a pfSense 2.x version released before May 2013, please specify -v 2.0 as a command line argument.
- Application code has been rewritten to be cleaner and provide support for the different protocols used to communicate with the different pfSense versions
