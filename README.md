2.4.2 - released February 22, 2017 - [download](https://github.com/KoenZomers/pfSenseBackup/raw/master/Releases/pfSenseBackupv2.4.2.zip) - 10 kb

- There was a minor modification to the backup page in pfSense 2.3.3. Added support for 2.3.3 and made it the default version. So if you're on 2.3.3 you don't need to provide the -v flag. If you're still on 2.3 you need to provide the -v 2.3 still.

2.4.1 - released April 6, 2016 - [download](https://github.com/KoenZomers/pfSenseBackup/raw/master/Releases/pfSenseBackupv2.4.1.zip) - 10 kb

- Incorrectly referenced the update to being for pfSense 3.2 whereas it should have been 2.3. Changed it in this minor update. Be sure to use the -v 2.3 flag.

2.4 - released April 5, 2016 - [download](https://github.com/KoenZomers/pfSenseBackup/raw/master/Releases/pfSenseBackupv2.4.zip) - 10 kb

- Added support for pfSense version 2.3 RC. Provide the -v 2.3 flag to instruct pfSenseBackup to use the protocol added for pfSense v2.3
- pfSenseBackup now requires the Microsoft .NET framework v4.6 to be installed (was 4.0 before) as pfSense v2.3 requires TLS 1.2 for SSL. Prior versions of the .NET Framework only support TLS 1.0. This requirement is regardless of which pfSense version you want to target.
